## Setting
Kujari Stabilisation Part 1 is the beginning of a story based campaign for Arma 3 set in Sub-Saharan Africa in 2007 where players take the role of Australian Defence Force Members.

Kujari is a small African country in Sub-Saharan Africa that has recently been overrun and terrorised by the Kujari National Liberation Front (KNFA). ADF personnel have been deployed on peacekeeping tasking, initiall in a small detatchment to assist the UN in humanitarian actions. KNFA violence has increased significantly in the weeks preceding the ADF deployment. 

## Background
Kujari Statbilisation was designed to give a fresh persepective of ADF operations in the 2007 period to the FoddSquad. This was done through community modifications to give a somewhat realistic and period accurate representation of ADF equipment.

The operation includes a Key Leader Engagement (KLE) with local elders, Sensitive Sight Exploition (SSE) through searching for signs of militia activity in the area, and an IED ambush by militia personnel.
